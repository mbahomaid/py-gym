## About

This exercise demonstrates how to use Python's built-in `sys` module to retrieve and display the version of Python installed on your system. It‚Äôs a great starting point for beginners to understand how to interact with system-specific information in Python.

---

## How It Works

The program uses the `sys` module, which provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. Specifically:
- `sys.version_info` returns a tuple containing the major, minor, and micro version numbers of Python.
- The program formats and prints this information in a user-friendly way.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `python_version_checker.py`.
2. Run the script using your Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python python_version_checker.py
   ```

## Example Output

If you‚Äôre using Python 3.10.12, the output will look like this:
```
You are using Python 3.10.12
```

Alternatively, if you print the full version string using `sys.version`, the output might look like this:
```
You are using Python 3.10.12 (main, Oct  3 2023, 12:00:00) [GCC 9.4.0]
```
