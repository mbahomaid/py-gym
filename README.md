# Py-Gym: Beginner-Friendly Python Exercises

Welcome to **Py-Gym**, a GitHub repository dedicated to providing beginner-friendly Python exercises! This repository is designed to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills through a variety of exercises. Currently, I am solving exercises from [W3Exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/), and I invite you to join me on this journey of learning and coding.

## About

**Py-Gym** is a collection of Python exercises aimed at beginners who are just starting their programming journey. The exercises cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced concepts. By working through these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience and build a strong foundation in Python programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Py-Gym**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mbahomaid/py-gym.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd py-gym
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Currently, there are no external dependencies required for these exercises. However, if any are added in the future, you can install them using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Start Solving Exercises:**
   - Navigate to the `exercises` directory and start working on the exercises. Each exercise is contained in its own file with a description and a placeholder for your solution.

## Exercises

The exercises are organized by topic and difficulty level. Here's an overview of the current structure:

- **Basic Exercises:** These exercises cover fundamental Python concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
- **Data Structures:** Exercises focusing on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Functions:** Practice defining and using functions, including lambda functions and recursion.
- **File Handling:** Learn how to read from and write to files.
- **Error Handling:** Exercises on using try-except blocks to handle exceptions.
- **Advanced Topics:** As you progress, you'll encounter exercises on more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, modules, and libraries.

Each exercise file contains a problem statement and a placeholder for your solution. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
